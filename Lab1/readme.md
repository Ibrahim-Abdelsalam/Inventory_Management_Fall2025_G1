# Inventory Management Lab 1 - Dollar-by-Value (DBV) Analysis

## Technical Documentation

### Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive Dollar-by-Value (DBV) inventory analysis system using Python. I developed this as part of our coursework and wanted to share it with fellow students to support our collective learning.

### Key Features
- Data import from CSV/Excel files
- DBV metric calculations (wi, si, cumulative percentages)
- ABC classification with configurable thresholds
- Professional Pareto chart visualization
- Automated analysis reports
- Export functionality for results

### Learning Objectives
Fellow students using this reference can explore:
1. Dollar-by-Value analysis methodology
2. ABC inventory classification principles
3. Python data analysis workflows
4. Visualization techniques for inventory data
5. Business interpretation of analytical results

### Getting Started
1. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed
2. Place your inventory data in the expected CSV format
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to see the analysis in action
4. Modify parameters to experiment with different scenarios
